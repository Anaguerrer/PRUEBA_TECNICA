In order to execute this procedure successfuly you need to follow the nexts steps:

1. You must register at https://rapidapi.com/ and access the free subscription. There you will be provided with a "token", which you must enter in the code.
All you have to do is replace the word "token" with the access provided by the API, on line 63 ("X-RapidAPI-Key": "token").

Once access is configured, we will install the packages and run the program:

1. Keep in mind that you must have python3 previously installed in your local environment and a virtual env should be initialized (but not necessarily).

2. To install the packages, just run the command: "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
It is possible that there are some packages not needed (the configuration has been generated automatically).
Please, if any package does not install correctly, do the individual installation separately; you can check the steps here:
https://pypi.org/


3. Once all the packages are successfully installed, run the command: "Python3 main.py"

The corresponding messages should be displayed in the terminal.
